# LoRA Training of Wan 2.1 14B 480p Video Generation Model with a Dragon Ball Anime Dataset

## Introduction & Goal

This project documents the end-to-end process of fine-tuning the powerful **Wan 2.1 Image-to-Video 14B** model to capture a specific artistic motion style. The training was conducted using the [diffusion-pipe](https://github.com/tdrussell/diffusion-pipe)  library, a high-performance tool designed for large-scale model training.

The primary goal was to create a **"Pure Style" LoRA**‚Äîa lightweight adapter that can animate static images with the dynamic, high-energy motion characteristic of *Dragon Ball Z/Super* fight scenes. Crucially, the LoRA was trained without specific character names in the captions, making it a flexible tool for applying this iconic animation style to any subject.

The final output of this project is a versatile LoRA file (`adapter_model.safetensors`) intended for use in popular inference engines like **ComfyUI** to generate new, stylized video content.

### Folder Breakdown:

*   üìÅ **`data_processor/`**
    This directory serves as the "workshop" for the entire dataset creation pipeline. It contains the scripts and source materials needed to transform long-form video into a curated set of training clips.
    -   `full_videos/`(**gitgnored on github**) is for storing source videos and `
    -   `clipped_videos/` (**gitignored on github**) is the destination for the final, processed clips and their corresponding captions.
    - `create_clips.py` : change a full video to  5 second videos based on the seconds specified in a txt folder.
    - `generate_video_summeries.py`: generate a summery of each 5 second videos in a txt file using a model(BLIP2 model)
*   üìÅ **`training/`**
    This folder contains the "blueprints" for the training process. These configuration files tell `diffusion-pipe` what to train and how to train it.
    -   `wan_14b_min_vram.toml`: Defines the main training parameters, such as learning rate, number of epochs, and memory-saving optimizations.
    -   `dataset.toml`: Specifies the path to the training data and parameters for how it should be processed (e.g., resolution, frame count).

*   üìÅ **`evaluation/`**
    This directory holds various Python scripts used for testing and validating the trained LoRA. These scripts are used to load the base model and the LoRA to generate sample videos for quality assessment.

*   üìÅ **`diffusion-pipe/`**
    This directory contains the core training engine. It is a clone of the official `diffusion-pipe` repository. **This folder is included in the `.gitignore` file** and is not tracked by this repository's version control. To replicate this project, you must clone `diffusion-pipe` separately into this location.


## 4.Dataset

The quality of a LoRA is a direct reflection of the quality of its training data. For this project, a  multi-stage curation process was employed to build a small but highly effective dataset, moving beyond simple automation to ensure every training example was purposeful.

The final dataset consists of **58 curated, 5-second video clips**  The videos can be found on huggingface, can be found (here).



### Clipping Strategy

Initial strategies involved random sampling, but to maximize the quality of the dataset, a **curated approach** was adopted. Using the `create_clips.py` script, 58 specific, high-impact moments were identified and extracted from the source movie. This ensured that every single clip in the dataset contained a meaningful, dynamic action sequence relevant to the training goal, such as:
-   Rapid punch and kick exchanges.
-   Explosive energy blasts.
-   Dramatic power-up sequences and aura flares.

The clips were extracted using [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html) in a frame-accurate mode to guarantee precision, a critical step for quality machine learning datasets.

### Captioning

Automated captioning was used as an initial step. The `generate_video_summaries.py` script, powered by the **BLIP-2 model**, provided a baseline description for each of the 58 clips.

Then, the final and most crucial phase was **manual review and curation of every caption.** Each auto-generated caption was replaced with a rich, descriptive prompt following a "Pure Style" philosophy. This involved:
-   **Omitting Character Names:** Using generic descriptions like "a warrior with golden hair" instead of "Goku" to ensure the LoRA learned a flexible *motion style* rather than a specific character.
-   **Adopting a Structured Prompt Format:** Each caption was written as a comma-separated list of tags and phrases, following a logical flow.


## 5. Tools & Techniques Used
*   **Core Library:** **`diffusion-pipe`**, which leverages Microsoft's **DeepSpeed** library to enable the training of massive models on limited hardware.

*   **Fine-Tuning Method:** **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique.
    *   **How:** Freezes the 14B parameter base model and trains only tiny "adapter" layers.
    *   **Benefits:** Results in a small LoRA file, faster training times, and preserves the base model's original knowledge.

*   **Hardware & Software:**
    *   **GPU:** A single **24GB VRAM** consumer GPU.
    *   **Environment:** **Conda** with **PyTorch**, `transformers`, and `diffusers`.

*   **Key Memory Optimizations (from `.toml` config):**
    *   **`transformer_dtype = 'float8'`**: Dramatically reduces VRAM by using 8-bit precision for the model's largest layers.
    *   **`activation_checkpointing`**: Trades computation for memory by re-calculating values instead of storing them.
    *   **`AdamW8bitKahan`**: An 8-bit optimizer that uses significantly less memory than its standard counterpart.


## 6. The Training Process: Step-by-Step Guide


### 1. Setup

First, prepare the environment by cloning the necessary repositories and installing dependencies inside a dedicated Conda environment.

```bash
# 1. Clone this project and the diffusion-pipe tool
git clone https://github.com/Long-form-AI-video-generation/lora_training_experiment.git
cd lora_training_experiment
git clone https://github.com/tdrussell/diffusion-pipe

# 2. Create and activate the Conda environment
conda create --name diffusion-pipe python=3.12 -y
conda activate diffusion-pipe

# 3. Install dependencies (install PyTorch first)
pip install torch torchvision torqudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install -r diffusion-pipe/requirements.txt

2. Configuration
Next, configure the training by editing the two .toml files located in the /training directory.
dataset.toml: Update the path variable to the absolute path of your clipped_videos dataset folder.

wan_14b_min_vram.toml: Update the ckpt_path to the absolute path of your downloaded base model and the output_dir to your desired save location.

3. Launching
Finally, launch the training using the deepspeed command. The following command is configured for a single GPU

run the command inside the diffusion-pipe folder, but make sure that **training folder have been moved inside to the diffusion pipe folder**  

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 NCCL_P2P_DISABLE="1" NCCL_IB_DISABLE="1" \
deepspeed diffusion-pipe/train.py --deepspeed --config training/wan_14b_min_vram.toml
